Group-A: Wireless Sensor Networks
1.	Install and configure Network Simulator- 2 /3. 

2.	Configure and Simulate wired sensor network with considering minimum 3 hops. Consider the following attributes for setting up the network using grid/random/vertical/Horizontal, Links (simplex/Duplex), Queue (DropTail/RED/FQ/DRR/SFQ/CBQ), Capacity, Propagation delay, queue size, agents (TCP/UDP), packet size, and apply application type (FTP/CBR), simulation start and stop time.   

3.	Configure and Simulate Wireless sensor network with considering minimum 3 hops. Apply the various network parameters to set up an application. Simulate with different agents and application types and queues and its sizes. 

4.	Simulate Mobile wireless sensor network with minimum 3 hops. Use Grid or random approach with variable queue types and packet sizes to simulate it. Give the comparative analysis with different network attributes.

5.	Design and implement Environmental Wireless Sensor application on Arduino/ZigBee/Wifi/Raspberry Pi development board. Configure different sensors and gather information using 1/2/3 hops and measure the network performance. Validate the experimental results.

6.	Design and implement Medical Wireless Sensor application on Arduino/ZigBee/Wifi/Raspberry Pi development board. Configure different sensors and gather information using 1/2/3 hops and measure the network performance. Validate the experimental results.

7.	Implement real time Object Tracking System using online APIs. 

8.	Setup Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Network on real time testbed (for example, ZigBee TestBed/ BLE TestBed/RF TestBed/WiFi TestBed).  Validate the results. Discuss challenges and essential requirements of heterogenous and homogenous wireless sensor networks.
